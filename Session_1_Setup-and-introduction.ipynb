    "Introduction to programming in the Python programming language. The goal of the first session is to learn about a programming language in general by getting familiar with the terminology. Also, in order to get ready for the coming sessions, we will jointly set up the programming environment and supporting software. In support hereto we have the first three chapters of the book \"A Beginners Guide to Python 3 Programming\" by John Hunt (available on Moodle and Github). \n",

    "* The interpreter \"translates\" the written Python code into machine-understandable code; it essentially takes care of the execution. In real life, you will most probably notice this as the Python *version*, in this case 3.x\n",
    "* The kernel takes care of communicating your code to the interpreter. It differs per IDE how this exactly works. We encounter this mostly when we made a mistake and froze a program: resetting it clears the memory and ends the execution. \n",
    "* The IDE is the part that you _see_: graphical software where you can write, run and test your code. Although there are many IDEs out there, we'll stick to Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook for this course. \n",
    "* Jupyter Notebooks are files that combine the execution of Python code and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) text. This allows you to intuitively communicate your code. \n",
    "* Libraries essentially are programmes that were written by other developers. These can be small, supporting a scientific publication or widely used tools. In this course we will make a start with using a couple, for data manipulation, visualisations and regressions. Full knowledge on the possibilities of each of them requires a course in its own (and a lot of practice!). \n",
